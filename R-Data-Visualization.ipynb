        "As a first step, we need to collect data.\n",

        "We asked them to provide sex information because we\n",
        "know there are two different groups of heights, males and females.\n",
        "\n",
        "One way to convey the heights to ET is to simply\n",

        "Again: The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects or numbers\n",

        "is as a compact description of a list with many elements.** For example: With categorical data, the distribution simply describes the proportions of each unique category. The sex represented in the heights data set can be summarized by the proportions of each of the two categories, female and male. This two category frequency table is the simplest form\n",
        "of a distribution we can form.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the data is numerical, the task is much more challenging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why ? In general, when data is not categorical, reporting the frequency of each unique entry is not an effective summary since most entries are unique.\n",

        "Statistics textbooks teach us that a more useful way\n",

        "is to define a function that reports the proportion of the data\n",
        "below a value A for all possible values of A. **This function is called a cumulative distribution function or CDF.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, we can report the proportion of values between any two heights,\n",
        "say a and b, by computing f of b, and then subtracting f of a.\n",

        "as opposed to using data as we do here, the word empirical\n",
        "is added to distinguish, and we use the term empirical CDF or ECDF.</small>\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the CDF provides all the information we need and it is widely discussed in statistics textbooks, the plot is actually not very popular in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main reason is that it does not easily convey characteristics of interest, such as,\n",
        "at what value is the distribution centered, is the distribution symmetric, what range contains 95% of the data.\n",
